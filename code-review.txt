11/28 Code Review:

General notes that don't belong in specific files:
	- Some files have two space indent, some have four - what the fuck
	- Write a real readme
	- Structure: the subdirectories are poorly organized
		- Why is AppContext just out in src; state management is pretty much the most central thing to an app, give it it's own directory
		- Why is there a directory for just Graph stuff
		- Use an assets directory in public/ for static files (jsons - yes, even if they're just temporarily hard coded)
		- Why is About.js in src

Notes I put in files but want to emphasize:
	- Stop importing react in functional components 
		- More generally, don't import shit you aren't using and check you use everything you import
	- Stop exporting functional components twice (hint: if they're a default export, you don't need to make them a non-default export)
	
Styling notes:
	- Don't use IDs for things that may be used again
	- Never, ever, ever access DOM elements directly, literally everything else is preferable to that
	- HRs are questionable (sort of thought of as similar to &nbsp)
	- If you need a z-index something is probably gross
