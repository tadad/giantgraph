# Giant Graph
Try it out at https://giantgra.ph  

Graph visualization Wikipedia. For any Wikipedia page, you can view a "map" of what page you are on, what pages you can go to, and what pages lead here.

# Motivation
When browsing the internet, users have no tool to show how pages connect together at a high level.
They can can only see the outgoing links from the current page, which are often scattered throughout the document.
There is no "map" of cyberspace which tells you where you are, where you can go, and what pages lead here.  
Lo! The Web was not constructed with the bidirectional link in mind.
This project lets users explore the birdirectional link strucutre of Wikipedia.
